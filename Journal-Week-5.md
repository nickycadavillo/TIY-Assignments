##Technical: Objects ###

Something technical I have learned before I entered The Iron Yard would be objects.  I've heard that almost _everything_ in Javascript
is an object.  Even arrays are objects.  Arrays hold a set of key-value pairs like all objects but the key for each value is their index number.
You can even combine arrays and objects.  You can put arrays in an object or objects in an array.  There are even built-in objects that 
browers have.  These are the browser object model, document object model and global javascript objects.

### Challenges ###
Some of the challenges i've faced were actually surprising this time around.  Working in pairs was actually more difficult than I anticipated.
Sometimes when you and your partner are not on the same page or pace, the task can be harder.  I found that I need to talk out loud more, 
try to explain my thought process, before moving on.  But I do enjoy working in pairs and in a group, and I hope to build this skill over time.
