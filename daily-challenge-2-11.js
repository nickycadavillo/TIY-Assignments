lifetime supply of your favorite snack: cookies

write a function named calculateSupply that takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day,
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age)
outputs the results to the screen like so:
"You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time


var age = 90 //ripe age constant
var amountPerDay = [5, 10, 15] //different values per day
var total;


function calculateSupply(age, amountPerDay){
    if 
}

console.log("You will need " + " to last you until the ripe old age of" + age)
console.log("You will need " + " to last you until the ripe old age of" + age)
console.log("You will need " + " to last you until the ripe old age of" + age)
